## The problem
Coordinating movie nights with friends can be challenging because everyone has different schedules and preferences. It can be difficult to find a time that works for everyone, and choosing a movie that everyone will enjoy can be a point of contention. Additionally, coordinating logistics such as location, food, and transportation can be a hassle. These challenges can make it difficult to plan and execute a successful movie night with friends. 

## Mission Statement
With the Movie Knight platform, users will be able to browse through a selection of popular and classic films, select a movie to watch at a specific date and time, and invite their friends to join them. They will also be able to create watch lists of movies they want to see and share these lists with their friends, allowing them to easily plan future movie nights and discover new films to watch together.

Overall, the Movie Knight project aims to provide a convenient and social platform for movie lovers to connect with their friends and plan movie nights together. Whether you're looking to schedule a casual movie night with a few close friends or plan a larger viewing party, Movie Knight has you covered.

## Target Audience
